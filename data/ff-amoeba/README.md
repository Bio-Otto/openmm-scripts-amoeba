# AMOEBA Force Field Parameter Files

This directory contains a set of additional force field parameter files for use with OpenMM, specifically:

* `amoebapro13` provides the [AMOEBA13](https://doi.org/10.1021/ct4003702) protein parameters combined with the [AMOEBA14](https://doi.org/10.1021/jp510896n) water model
* `lipids` provides the parameters for [DOPC and POPE lipids](https://doi.org/10.1080/00268976.2018.1436201)

Note that parameters for the original [AMOEBA03](https://doi.org/10.1021/jp027815+) water model are already built into OpenMM and are included in its `amoeba2013.xml` file.
