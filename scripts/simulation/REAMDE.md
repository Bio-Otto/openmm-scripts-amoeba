# Scripts for Running AMOEBA Force Field Simulations in OpenMM


* `simulate_amoeba.py` performs an individual equilibrium molecular dynamics simulation
* `simulate_amoeba_umbrella` performs an MD simulation where the relative position of a target ion is harmonically restrained, facilitating umbrella sampling

Type `./scriptname -h` to see a help on which input parameters need to be provided.

For examples of how to run simulations with these scripts on a remote cluster see [blah](../../scripts/cluster-submission/README.md).
